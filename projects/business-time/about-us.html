      We were started by a shoesmith in 1824 in Rutland Vermont by Issac Rockwell. Rockwell's shoes quickly gained a reputaion for their quality, and it wasn't long until the Rockwell name became synonymous with quality. Over the years our boots have been worn by outlaws, lawmen, frontiersmen, pioneers, prospectors, farmers, ranchers, and just about everyone in between. We've handled the harshest conditions nature has thrown at us. We are proud of our legacy and work hard to continue making the same quality of boots as we always have.
